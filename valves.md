# Valves
As a starting point we are considering: https://www.instructables.com/id/3d-Printing-Servo-Controlled-and-Other-Valves/ and will be iterating on designs as required.

The info for from this article is summaried below for reference and the additional files needed to make these are in the 'valves' folder.

## Intro
Functional valves for air and water can be 3D printed. This guide shows how to make micro-servo controlled valves, gate valves, check valves, and adjustable flow valves. These are used within the OpenO2 project.
