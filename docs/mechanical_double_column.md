# Double Column Design

A double column design has a number of advantaged over the single column design:

1. a more continuous flow of oxygen is achieved
2. better energy efficiency is achieved as pressure can be equalised between the pressurised column and the one which is being regenerated at the end of a cycle.

This design can be used as a PSA unit. However, we have found much better energy efficiency is achieved if running as a VPSA (Vaccuum pressure swing adsorption). In this configuration, one bed carries out the oxygen separation while the other bed is regenerated under a vacuum. In addition to energy efficiency there are numerous other advantages to VSA including 1) longer service life - PSA vessels commonly need repacking of seive material every 5 years or so; 2) better performance at high alitudes;

A bill of materials of the parts required can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqJh-xu9-mF_WmV-_YwSlctiakFPunPQr3RjApXQSe0/edit?usp=sharing you can comment - so feel free to ask any question or add your comments if anything is not clear.

We've actively working on further documentation at the moment so please bear with us.
